Maroon is a pirate-themed programming language that makes coding as adventurous as sailing the high seas! Written in Python, it features a unique syntax inspired by pirate parlance while maintaining functional programming capabilities.

## Update v1.2 - The Crew Expansion
### New Features & Booty

#### Default Function Parameters
```bash
voyage raid(island be "Tortuga", loot be "gold"):
    bark "Plundering" loot "from" island
end voyage

raid()
raid("Port Royal", "emeralds")
```
#### Parentheses Support
`booty be (10 divided_by 2) plus (3 times 4)`

#### Modular Code Imports
```bash
import "cannon_loader.maroon"
import "navigator/star_chart"
```

#### Enhanced String Operations
```bash
bark shout("whisper")
bark split_loot("apple|banana|coconut", "|")[1]
bark join_crew(list of "A", "B", "C", "D"), " - ")
```
#### Advanced Collection Tools
`treasure_map be list of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`

#### Shuffle like a proper pirate
`bark shuffle(sails with treasure_map)`

#### Weighted loot selection
```bash
loot be list of "common", "rare", "legendary"
chances be list of 60, 35, 5
bark weighted_choice(sails with loot, chances)
```
#### Functional Programming

`doubloons be list of 1, 2, 3, 4`

#### Map: Triple all values
`tripled be map(doubloons, "times", 3)`

#### Filter: Keep > 2 pieces
`rich_beards be filter(doubloons, "greater_than", 2)`

#### Reduce: Sum the loot
`total be reduce(doubloons, "plus")`

#### Improved Operations üîß
New comparisons: greater_or_equal, less_or_equal

Complex math expressions: `(5 plus 3) times (10 divided_by 2)`

Nested list declarations: `list of list of 1,2, list of 3,4`

#### Bug Fixes & Stability üêõ
- Fixed parser issues with random functions
- Anchored list declaration parsing
- Repaired plunder loop navigation
- Patched floating-point treasure miscalculations
- Secured First Mate's quarters (now inactive by default)

Yo Ho Ho! With v1.2, Maroon now supports proper code organization, advanced list operations, and safer navigation through stormy code seas. Sail with confidence knowing your First Mate won't squawk unless summoned! ü¶ú‚öîÔ∏è


## Update v1.1
### New Control Structures

#### While loops with comparison operators

`while counter be less_than 3 bark counter`

#### Plunder loops (foreach)

`plunder each coin from treasure_chest bark coin`

#### Repeat loops

`repeat 3 times bark "BOOM!"`

### Choose statements (switch/case)
```
choose x:
    case 1: bark "one"
    default: bark "unknown"
end choose
```

### Error Handling
```
brace for impact:
    bark "Dangerous waters"
if capsized, bark "Error!"
```

### Functional Operations

- List comprehension: `list of 1, 2, 3 where each times 2`
- Filter: `coins where it greater_than 5`
- Reduce: `reduce coins with result plus it`

### String Operations

- Upper/lower case: `"hello" upper`
- Split/join: `"hello world" split " "`

### Custom Dialects
```
dialect Caribbean:
    "shout" be "bark"
    "expedition" be "voyage"
end dialect
```
### New Math & Randomization features
```
bark roll_dice sails with 20
bark random_float sails with
bark random_float sails with 10, 20

crew be list of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
bark random_pick sails with crew
bark random_sample sails with crew, 3
bark normal_random sails with

# Math operations 
x be 5
bark factorial sails with x

angle be 3.14159
bark sin sails with angle
bark cos sails with angle
bark tan sails with angle

bark exp sails with 2
bark log sails with 10
bark log sails with 8, 2

# Statistical operations
numbers be list of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
bark mean sails with numbers
bark median sails with numbers
bark sum sails with numbers

# Gaming functions
bark flip_coin sails with
bark roll_multiple sails with 3, 6
bark roll_multiple sails with 2, 20
```

## Features

- Pirate-themed syntax that's both fun and functional
- Built-in type system with support for numbers, strings, booleans, and lists
- Function definitions using `voyage` keyword
- Rich set of mathematical and logical operations
- Built-in debugging tools
- Scope management with variable stacking
- Exception handling with pirate-flavored error messages

## Core Syntax

### Variable Assignment
```
treasure be 42
message be "Ahoy, world!"
```

### Arithmetic Operations
- `plus`: Addition
- `minus`: Subtraction
- `times`: Multiplication
- `divided_by`: Division
- `modulo`: Modulus
- `power`: Exponentiation

### Built-in Functions
- `bark`: Print output
- `count_booty`: Length function
- `plunder`: Maximum value
- `abandon`: Minimum value
- `debug_chest`: Debug current scope
- `sqrt`, `abs`, `round`: Mathematical operations
- `to_int`, `to_float`, `to_str`: Type conversion

### Function Definition
```
voyage greet(name):
    bark "Ahoy," name
end voyage
```

### Lists
```
crew be list of "Jack", "Anne", "Mary"
add "Blackbeard" to crew
```

### Conditionals
```
if gold be greater_than 100, then bark "Rich!" else bark "Poor!"
```

## Error Handling

The interpreter provides detailed error messages through the `PirateException` class, helping developers navigate through rough seas of debugging.

## Development

The interpreter is built with clean, modular Python code featuring:
- Regular expression parsing
- Robust type system
- Comprehensive operator support
- Modular function handling

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run Maroon scripts with `.maroon` extension
3. Start writing your pirate-themed programs!

Example:
```
treasure be 42
bark "Me treasure chest holds" treasure "gold pieces!"
```
4. Run the script with:
python main.py yourfilename
or python main.py for the shell
